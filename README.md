# EVE_Station_Trading

EVE Online is an MMORPG set in space that is well known for its entirely player driven markets. In EVE Online, players can buy and sell in-game items through the market by setting up buy orders and sell orders. I was never good at the other more exciting features of the game, like combat and exploration, so I earned isk (the in-game currency) by trading items at the largest station in the EVE universe.

When I first started out, I would manually pore through the thousands of items on the market and look for large bid-ask spreads, buying low and selling high. Typically I would look for items that were being traded at high volumes so that it'd be easier for me to get a slice of the pie.

After a few weeks of doing this manually, I learned that there was an official EVE API. I realized I could pull live market data and run a program to calculate every single arbitrage opportunity, rank them, and filter out any low volume items. This program saved me hours a day.
